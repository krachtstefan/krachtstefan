Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Stefan,

I live in hamburg and work as a full stack developer. I love programming, pen plotting, 3d printing and running.

A few projects of mine:

- [Raceday.me](https://raceday.me/) - Personalized race day live tracking for runners (iOS/Android/Web)
- [stefan.wtf](https://stefan.wtf) - My personal website/blog
- [LINNR - itâ€™s not snake! ](https://linnr.de/) - A small game I made with my friend [Wischnik](https://wischnik.de/) during a Game Jam
- [Runverter.io](https://runverter.io/) - A calculator for runners
- [amz.tools](https://amz.tools/) - The company I work for
